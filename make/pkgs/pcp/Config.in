		PCP client library implements client side of PCP (RFC 6887)
		and NATPMP (RFC 6886) protocols. Switch to NATPMP is done 
		automatically by version negotiation. This library enables any
		network application to manage network edge device (e.g. to
		create NAT mapping or ask router for specific flow treatment).
