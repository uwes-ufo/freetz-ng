		For FritzOS since v7.5x only.
		Configuration of port forwardings to the FritzBox itself
		by using voip_forwardrules.
		The packets are tagged with DiffServ/DSCP and some devices
		may route it different, eg Telekrom Hybrid always via dsl
		because Telefon ohne Kabel gibts nicht.
		Warning:
		This package changes the ar7.cfg. On syntax errors AVM
		will reset the whole file to default, including default
		password and default ip. Backup you config before!
